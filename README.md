Mod Information
=======

Changes many things about the functionality of mobs, primarily focused around more dynamic difficulty changes:

*Italics indicate that the change does not function properly without the Mob Tweaks Resource Pack*

If a hostile entity is hit by a Skeleton, Stray, Bogged, Pillager, Piglin, Wither, or Ender Dragon, they now have a chance to not retarget to said mob. The
chances are 0% in Easy, 50% in Normal, and 100% in Hard
